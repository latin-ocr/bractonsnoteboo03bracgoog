transactione of the Easter term end and those of the Trinity
term begin. If that be its meaning Ι do not think that it is
quite in the right place, for in Cascs 5, (³, and 7 we read of
what was done three weeks after S. John's day ie. Mid-
summer. On the whole I still think that the fifteen extracta
in question, or all but the first two or three, belong to Trinity
ab. 1218 (1112), but that they may well have been preceded
in the Note Book by a few extracta from the Hilary and
Easter terms.
”efflet In that case the maker of the N ote Book had the rolls
illim„ sor all terma from the beginning of the reign down to and
including Trinity 1218. From Michaelmas 1218 (nu. 2-3)
there are no extracta The Oourt sat in that term and
Bracton cites a solitary case. So this we must account an
instance of Bracton having had a roll which the maker of the
Note Book is not proved to have had. From Hilary 1219
, (Aa. 3) we get no extracts; but Bracton cites no case; no
fines have been found3 an cyro on a large scale was going on,
and we may conclude that the Bench at Westminster was
unoccupied¹.

From the next nine terms the Note Book has extracts
and Bracton has citatione. We pass therefore unchecked to
Trinity 1221 (Aa. 5). From this the Note Book has nothing.
Bracton apparently has one case. But Ι have found no roll
and no fines and think it very doubtful whether the Court
sat. On the morrow of Trinity‚ Pateshull, Hareng and
Lexington, three of the usual judges of the Bench, began an
eyre in the west which seems to have kept them away
throughout the summer and far into the autumn².

From the next term again, Michaelmas 1221 (aa. 5-6)
there is nothing in the Note Book. Bracton does not cite any
cases distinctly from Mich. 11. 5-6; bnt he cites eight from
1111111116. This seems at first sight ambiguous; but six 0
out of the eight are essoin cases which would, I suppose, be ⁷
adjudged on the first days of the term, and I infer therefore
