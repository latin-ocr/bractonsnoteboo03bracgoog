extracts from the four next terms, ending with Easter 1231
(nn. 18). This is the last roll from which it gives extracta
and with it Bracton's continuous series 01 citations from the
10110 01 the Bench comes 10 011 end.

{ygggylg To sum up then, the Note Book has extraets from all the

01‘110 aenea 10110 from which Bracton took his cases except four viz. that
for Michaehnas 1218 (aa. 2-3) from which one case is
10001101111101101Τ111111γΙ221 (aa. 5) from which one case
is vouched, that for Trinity 1223 (1117) from which there
are 11100110110110, that 101Η110111232 (nu. 16) which yields
a 0011101)Υ ease. This list 01 exceptions might perhaps be yet
further reduced, 10111 seems doubtful whether the Oourt sat
in Trinity 1221 01 Trinity 1232, and very possible that the
apparent mention 01 those terms in the treatise is due to
some mistake 01 the author, his copyists or editors But
taking things as they stand, it is pla-in that if Bracton had

10110 from these four terms he has used them very sparingly.

2. Bolls of pleae which followed the King.

12ng As 'regards the 10110 01 pleas which followed the King the

ook had just the same six consecutive 10110.

3. Eyre Bolls

suenone The Eyre Rolls cannot be so brielly dismissed. Braeton
had about twenty eyre 10110 01 Pateshull and five 01 Raleigh.
The Note Book gives selectione from but eight 10110, 011 01
them are 10110 01 Pateshull, all save one of thern are 10110
used by Bracton. These 001001101ιο from eyre 10110 010 the
last things in the Note Book. We have above seen reason
for believing that tho end 01 that book has perished‚ also 101
believing that the part that has perished comprised extracts
from the Worcester cyre roll of 1221 and the Linooln eyre
101101 1219. Το both 01 these Bracton has appealed for 00000. ⁸
There 10 nothing, as it seems to me, to be said against
the supposition that, were tho Note Book as complete as
once it was, it would give us extracts from all the eyre 10110
cited by Braoton. But then there is nothing to be said for
