comprise all Bracton’s cases and yet that Bracton should
have had nothing *to do with the 0110100, would be most
unlikely. A calculation of chauces is indeed impossible for
some cases were doubtless more interesting than others, and
a certain agreement between different lawyers as 10 what
cases were 01 31031 value might be expected3 still the coinci-

that it was 301 1011311033.

“· ι 33330311 As already explained, the Note Book has no
selectione from a considerable number 01 10113, mostly cyre
rolls, used by Bracton. But considering only those rolls from
which there 310 extracta in the Note Book, the result to which
I have 00310 13, that among these extracta there are rather
more than 11311 the cases which Bracton vouches from the
same rolls¹. Some allowance must be made 101 1313131103 01
31130. I may well have failed ,10 identify some of Bracton’s
' cases. The proper names which occur in his text have been
horribly distorted by copyists, for example an Archdeacon 01
Το13033 (Archidiaconus de Tottona) has become Alfridus de
Cottone and Viel D’Engaine (Vitalis de Engaine) has become
’ the Vicar 01 Gaine3 11113 throws difficulties in one's way.
Again a good many cases Bracton cites anonymously‚ that is
10 say, he merely states that a case about this or 11131 matter
will be found on a particular roll, but does not name the
parties, It is sometimes hard for a modern to be certain
whether he has found such a case3 and if any mistahe has
been made by copyist or printer in giving the date, the case
will hardly be found. That such mistakes have occurred is
certain3 still I would not attribute to them any weighty .

Certainly not a few 01 the cases, which Bracton has cited and
which yet are not in the Note Book, may be found just
where they ought to be, on the rolls whence they 310 cited
by the Bracton of the printed book; others I have not found;
