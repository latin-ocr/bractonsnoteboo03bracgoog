Provisions ordain that in such a case no line shall be due¹.
Again it was one of the flagrant grieva'nces of the time that
no damages could be had in the assiae of mort d’ancestor;
this in many cases enabled a lord to keep out the heir for a
considerable while without making compensation; this grave
abusa was redressed by the Provisions²: Bracton uses strong
language about it, thinks that damages should be given ad
reprimendam malitiam dominorum capitalium, suggests (as it
seems to me) that damages may be given, but confessos that
hitherto (hucusque) they have not been given⁸. This is
¹ hardly the language of one who knew of the Provisions but

held them invalid⁴.

lecti. The essoinee is given a period of a year and a day for
his sickness3 at the end of that time he must appear. But
how is the year to be reckoned3 in particular what is to be
done about leap year? Bracton argues this question at length
in a very curious passage⁶. The point, he admits, is disputed,
but his own opinion is that in every case a year for this purpose
means 365 days and 6 hours, so that the essoinee will always
have precisely the same space of time no matter whether
a aoth of February occurs or n0. A closely similar passage is
found in the Note Book, and there what Bracton regards as
the true doctrine is ascribed to Martia that is, doubtlesa to

Martin of Pateshullss. Now it has long been known that the
law on this point was fixed by an ordinance⁷. The Record
commissionem when printing that ordinance in their edition
of the Statutes seem to have thought that the best authority
for it was a copy in the Rcd Book of the Exchequer‚ where it
