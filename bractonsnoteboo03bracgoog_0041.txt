fflfflp One thing is clear. His name was not Bracton but
'¹5:¹35‘ Henry of Bratton. It is written a very large number ol'
times upon contemporary Rolls and Feet os Fines and the
only variant for Bratton that is at all common is Bretton.
Certainly most of the MSS. of his treatise that I have seen
give a clear Bracton3 but their readings of proper names are
extremely corrupt; one has, for instance, to recognize the
English villages ol Hatfield, Swanscombe and Itteringham
under such monstrosities as Heefenur, Suanthanis and
J udlibam ¹. There is no room sor doubt that the text writer
was the judge whose name appears on roll after roll, or that
the judge's name if not Bratton was Bretton However
Braoton he has been for centuries, and so let him be to the
end.
He hasbeen claimed by two Devonshire villages, Bratton
’ Fleming near Exmoor‚ Bratton Clovelly near Dartmoor‚ also
by Bratton Oourt in the parish of Minehead on the Somerset-
shire side of Exmoor. There is but little evidence in favour
of any of these claims; there is another Bratton in Somerset-
abire, Bratton Seymour near Wincanton, there are Brattons
in Sbropshire and Wiltshire, Brettons in Yorkshire and'
Wales; but there are good reasons for connecting him with
Devonshire. In 1212 a William Raleigh was presented by
the king to the church of Bratton Fleming’3 he may have
been the William Raleigh whose judgments Braoton has
made immortal and Braoton may have been his pupil. As
proof of Bracton’s connection with Bratton Court, a tomb in
the church os Minehead has been shown as his, but it seems ’
beyond doubt that he was buried in the nave of Exeter ⁴
Cathedral where long afterwards Bratton’s altar stood,
Bratton’s bell was rung, and Bratton’s mass was chanted.
We are thus absolved from believing that he had, like the
