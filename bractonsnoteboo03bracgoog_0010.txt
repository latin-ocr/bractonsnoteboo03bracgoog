PREFACE.

. MY hest thanks are due, in the first place, to my

friend Mr Georgo Barnes of the Inner Temple,
and when 1 say that he laboriously made and gener-
ously gave me that index of personal names which
will add much to the value of this book, it will be
seen that I have good cause to be grateful :—also 10
Mr J. M. Rigg of Lincoln’s Inn 101 having copied
(very carefully as I afterwards found) some thirty
pages of the manuscript at a time when I was
otherwise engaged :-also to Mr James Greenstreet,
who has long known the manuscript, for some useful
suggestions :—to the gentlemen who have charge
01 the Public Record Offioe, more especially to
Mr Walford Selby, for many courtesies which have
made my days among the rolls very pleasant t—to
Mr Hampshire the Librarian of Exoter Cathedral
for a copy 01 a deed relating toBracton's place of
burial, which he kindly sent to me :—to Mr Melville
Bigelow of Boston and Professor Thayer of Harvard
for the encouragement given me by friendly letters
