NOTE ΟΝ THE CLASSIFIOATION OF THE EXTANT
PLEA Bonus

The yet extent Plea Rolls of Henry the Third’s reign arc arranged
at the Public Record Office in three classes (1) Coram Rege Bolls (Ι)
Assize Rolls, (3) Tower Assize Rolls or Tower Coram Rege Rolls. This
arrangement hae been determined partly by the fact that in time past
some of tha rolls were preserved in the Tower and some at westminster.
That a roll is now found in a particular class, is by no means a sure
indication of its real nature, for instance, it may happen that one of
two duplicate rolls will be among the Coram Rege Rolls and the other
among the Assize Rolls. Therefore in citing a roll aa Coram Rege Roll
No. 91, Assize Roll M. Ι, 3, 1, or Tower Boll No. 4, Ι imply nothing as
to the character of the roll, but merely give the reader a name whereby
he may obtain the document to which Ι refer. In citing a particular
membrana of a roll, Ι refer to the figures which have been set upon ita
membranas by a modern pencil.
