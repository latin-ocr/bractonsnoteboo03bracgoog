But his main debt is less palpablc, for what he has con- Ι
verted to his use is spirit rather than substance, not these or ’
those mles, but a niethod of reasoning about law, of perceiving
the interdependenee of rules, of making them take their
places as members of a body. He is at his very worst when
he copies matter from Azo, as he does very freely in those
parts ol' his book, which, being the first, are unfortunately the
best known. He isthere dealing with high generalities about
things and persons, to these English law had not yct

ascended, and (even when allowance has been made for the ,
blunders of mediaeval copyists and the negligence of editors)
we are forced to say that his copyings from Azo are not
always very intelligent, he fails to take point after point

and weaves a rational text. A parallel as good as most his-
torical parallels is ready to hand. Within our own century a,
great foreign civilian has left his mark on some of the very
best of our English text-books, not making thern any the less
English, only making thern more reasonable by having placed
their writers ata standpoint outside the English system, a
standpoint whence a wood might be seen, not merely a quan·
tity of trees. Azo was the Savigny of the thirteenth century¹.
It is to be regretted that no one has yet printed a good

this is done, shall we fully understand the influence of Roman

upon English law. But it is much more to be regretted that

lWhen Ι wrote the above I had civilians (Roman Low in Enylond,
not yet read Mr Scrutton's careful pp. 79-121), which seems to me very
estimato ol Bracton’s debt to the just.
