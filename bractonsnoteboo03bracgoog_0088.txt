0111111111· At the beginning of the second quire (top margin 31 what

now 131 11111313 1s an important legend written in what
seems to me a hand 31 1113 fifteenth century. This however,
most unfortunately‚ has been in part erased Apparently the
erasure is due to some person wh0, perhaps in the same
century, numbered the first 31 leaves 31 the book. He
scratched out part of the legend m question in 311131 13 make
room for‘ ‘.fo xj⁰''. Possibly a skilled palaeographer might

still read the whole. What I can read rs this: -

Md quod iste liber 33111131 in se viginti quatuor quarterna et constat .........
ex dimissione ...............

The writer therefore seems to have known the book as
containing 1311 and twenty quires; hence we may infer that
it ended then where it ends now, that nothing has been lost
since his day.

The ninth quire has but eleven leaves. The 31113313
from a certain roll come toan end half-way down the 11311 31
the eleventh leaf ; the rest 31 the frent and the whole 31 the

new title and 31113313 from a new roll. I 11131 that here
there has been no loss, merely an economizing 31 parchment.
The tenth quire again is ampler than the rest; it has fourteen
leaves. The leaves have been recently numbered in pencil
from first to last. Altogcther there are 287 leaves (first
quire 10 leaves, ninth quire 11 leaves, tenth quire 11 leaves,
twenty- -313 quires 31 12 leaves each, total 287 leaves). The
quires begin with the leaves numbered l, 11, 23, 35, 17, 59,
71, 83, 95, 106, 120, 132, 111, 156, 168, 180, 192, 201, 216,
228, 210, 252, 261, 276.

Seemingly when the book was originally made the quires
were numbered consecutively‚ the number being placed in
the bottom margin 31 the first leaf 31 each quire 3111331311-
words were put at the end 31 each quire. These have suffered
much from the binder's shears3 but I see no reason to believe
that anything has perished out 31 1113 middle 31 the book save
