‘Appendix to the requisite size; perhaps then the copyist
¹omitted one of the eight cases That one of them was in the
Note Book is made the more probable by this, that the same
case at a later stage appears in another part of the Note
Book, and the annotator has there written in the margin
alibi supra, meaning that the sarno case was to be found
above, which would only be true if it stood on the page now
lost¹.

Ι e The method employed for restoring this lost page might,
ᾖ Ι thought, be also used for determining the question, whether

'⁸ ¹ anything andis anything, what, had been lost from the end

of the Note Book The process could only be applied in a
one-sided fashion3 it might give positive but could not give
negative results. The fact that a roll was not scored, would
prove nothing, for the maker of the Note Book might have
had a duplicate roll. The fact that a roll was scored, would
go to prove that extracts from it were once in the book ;
though this would not be quite certain, for the direction to copy
might never have been obeyed, or the copy might have been
made in some other book. A search, (I dare not say an
exhaustive, but still a diligent search) through the plea rolls
of tho first forty years of Henry's reign, (Ι must gratefully
acknowledge the help given me by Mr W. F. Noble,) resulted
in the discovery of but two rolls, from which there were no
<extracts in the Note Book, and which yet were scored in the
· tome familiar fashion. This result is small was satisfactory.
One of these two rolls was a roll sor the cyre of 1221,
that cyre of Martin Pateshull and the Abbot of Reading in
the mid-western counties which Bracton has made famous ;
the county was Worcester². Now cases from this eyre,
Leicestershire and Staffordshire cases are the last things
now in the Note Book The probability therefore seems
very strong that the marks on this Worcester roll were
obeyed, extracts from that roll are just what we might
expect to follow cases heard in other counties during the
same eyre. This Worcester roll, again, has one inscription
