to limit the kingly power rests mainly 011 a passage the
authenticity of which is extremely doubtful, aud William
Raleigh whatever he may have become as bishop, was
as judge distinctly a kiug’s friend More probable does
it seem that the bias was not political, but juristic‚ that
Bracton regarded Pateshull and Raleigh as the heads of
a school of law and of lawyers. Of rival schools of lawyers
Englishmen know little. For centuries past our scheme
of justice has been so concentratod that rival schools have
been impossible. Every lawyer has belonged to the one
orthodox school of westminster, or has been simply ‘no
lawyer '. Blackbum, Mansfield Halo, (loke, Littleton do not
found sects; Bracton himself, so far as we know, founded
none. But in the first half of the thirteenth century it may
well have been otherwise and it was otherwise obruad. The
rapid influx of civil litigation into the royal court must have
demanded a rapid development of common law: and there
well may have been strong and permanent differences of
opinion among judges and lawyers even about fundamentals
There may have been Proculiaus and Sabinians. In particular
the respect to be paid to Roman law may have been a hotly
contested point. We do not know how this was3 perhaps
we hear only oue side of the case3 the school of Pateshull
and Raleigh still lives and is eloqueut3 its rivals, if rivals it
had, perished for they had no spokesman to match against
Bracton. Lastly we may not forget that when Bracton visits
Devonshire‚ he chooses a Raleigh to sit with himen the

bench, and that he holds land of the Raleighs. Possibly he

was the pupil, the clerlr‚ the friend of Bishop William.

. At any rate the fact remeius—the apparent preference of
χ ¹ two judges ofa past time above all other judges past or

present. But in order to duly weigh this fact we must

l s descend to particulars, and consider whence it was that
Bracton obtained his lore of cases. .

rualenus He cites as Ι reckon 494 cases; this includes some vague
lilim alludens—to matters of unceYt'ain' date. The nature of his
citations may be seen from the following table whichis

approximately correct.
