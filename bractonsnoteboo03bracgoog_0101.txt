CHOICE OF 120th ΒΥ BRACTON AN 1) THE Annornroa. 75

that the term to which they belong is Michaelmas 6-7; the
essoins of that term would be taken before the coronation
day.

The next term for which the Note Book has nothing is
Trinity 1223 (aa. 7) and from this Bracton vouches two
cases No roll has been found and no fines3 but Bracton's
citations are perhaps correct.

Term now follows term in thc Note Book until Trinity
Aa 10 is reached. That and tho next two terms arc
unrepresented. So they are in the treatisc also. No roll is
extant and I have seen no fines. Probably the Court did
not sit3 a great eyre¹ was taxing the judicial resources. In
the Note Book the plcas for the next term, Ecstor 1227
(aa 11) are described as ιΡ1001”10...Ῑ1001 reditum 1011101011-
orum de itinere²'. On these follow cases from Trinity term
’ of the same year, but it sccms clear³ that after these thc
Noto Book proceeds to give without any new heading, (the
omission may bc due to more carolessncss,) cases from the
Hilary and Easter terms of 1228 (alt. 12). Thus a lcap is
made over Michaelmas 1227 (aa. 11-12). From that term
Bracton draws no case ; Ι have found neither roll nor finc;
an cyre in many counties was begun in September⁴3 probably
the Bench was without an occupant, Trinity 1228 (Aa 12)
is unrcpresented in the Note Book, the treatise, the rolls, the
fines

No check now occurs until Hilary 1232 (Aa. 16). Bracton
has one citation; the Note Book no extract3 no roll is found,
but there were judges taking fines at Westmiuster and at
times Baleigh was of them. As to the Trinity term of the
same year we are everywhere met hy negatives3 no extracts3
no citations3 no roll; no fines. This was the time when
Raleigh made that tour in the midlands which supplied
, Bracton with many decisions The Note Book has nothing
from Easter 1233; but Bracton has nothing from this term3
apparently a Court was sitting at westminster, but Raleigh
was not there. Without any break the Note Book has
