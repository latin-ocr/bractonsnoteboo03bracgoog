138 POSTSORIPT TO INTRODUCTION.

the terminaticn of which name may, as it seems tc me, be a
rationalistic perversion by English mouths of something
Celtic.

On pp. 50, 51 Ι have said that there are but three
occasions on which Braotcn notices a difference of opinion
between Segrave and any other judge, that once the diffe-
rence is between Segrave and Pateshull, twice between
Segrave and Raleigh. Ι now see that on f. 438 where
Bracton speaks of Segrave's doctrine about the second
husband's curtesy, he does not say that the opposite opinion
was held by Raleigh. My statement therefore would be
more correct if it ran thus :-“ Once the difference is
between Segrave und Pateshull, once between Segrave and
Raleigh, and once Segrave is represented as holding that the
law hasbeen misunderstcod and perverted.'' It seems clear
that Segrave's opinion as to curtesy did not become law.
See Case 1182, also the Statute de Dotis and Coke's
comment there0n‚ 2 Inst. 336, 8 Rep. 35 b.

On p. 76 Ι have said that Bractou apparently had three
De Banco rolls from which there are no excerpts in the
Note Book, but that this number might perhaps be reduced
were the manuscripts examined. Ι believe that Ι can reduce
it by one. In the first four manuscripts at which Ι look
(MA, ΜΒ, ΜΟ, ΜΙ) the case which the printed book
(1342b) cites from Hilary nn. 16, is cited from Hilary An.
18. Ι have not however been able to get rid of the citatione
from Trinity AR. 5 and Trinity alt 7.

As regards Oole’s case (p. 100), it may be observed that
one Roger Oole was a canon cf Exeter iu 1224, see Case

920.-
