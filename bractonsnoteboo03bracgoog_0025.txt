01 1110 author that parallel 10 1110 carefully arranged quotations
from early rolls 111010 runs a string 01 irregular references to
later cases. A trial is mentioned, 101 instance, 10 which 1110
heirs 01 John 01 Munmuth were parties, Now the said John
died immediately before 1259¹ (RohertS, ‘calendarium Genealo
gioum,' i. 73), and sothe casual illustration has been taken from
a case fresh in the remembrauce of the author when he composed
the corresponding part of the treatise. The case Roger de
Regni c. Robert da Shute, entered as a heading 10 one of 1110
paragrapho in 1110 editione, is nothing but a similar side reference
10 0 11101 which may be still read at the Record Office on an
assiae 1011 01 Β1001011 101 1154100100 Rege, Henry III., N. 96,
m. 4). And so in the work 110011 we have 1110 like marginal
illustraticns as in the notebook, and a careful collation 01 the
MSS. 01 Β1001011 would bring them easily out in their original
character 01 side-notes Now, one of the most interesting among
the Bracton MSS, Digby 222 111 the Bodleian Library, 01 which
that wondrous productiori called Sir Travers Twiss’s edition 01
Β1001011 does not take the slightest notice, gives as marginal
references two 01 the most 000001000001110011011101110101100οο1
the note-book, 1110 Oorbyn case on the subject 01 warranty and
1110 Ralph 01 Arundell case.

Summan'zing briefly the evidence in respect 01 Bracton's
connexion with the note-hook in the British Museum, I lay
again stress on the following points: 1. The abstracts from rolls
in the Add. MS. and the 10110 which served as material for tha
drawing up 01 tha treatise are substantially the same. 2. There
010 passages in the treatisc which even in their wording connect
themselves with notes in 1110 Add. MS. 3. The illustrative
references in the Add. MS. can he traced in 001110 1110100000 10
Β1001011’0 own practica, and in two cases are found 10 recur in
MSS. of Bracton’s work.

My paper has grown 10 such an inordinate length already
that I do not venture 10 hint at the importance 01 the matter
collected in the British Museum ΜΒ. Ι1 seems sufficient for tha
present to say that the nota-book gives a copious and careful
selection of 000001101111110 early practice 01 Henry ΙΙΙ.ῗο time,
