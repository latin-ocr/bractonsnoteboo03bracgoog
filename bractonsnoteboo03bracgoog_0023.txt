The whole disquisition about the natural and artificial, the
common and the leap year, given in the treatise,is set out at
greater length, but with 5 liternl repetition oi some characteristic
sentences, in the note-book (195 5). The quaint comparisonsoi ¹
the year of 365 days 55 5 bird withouta tail and oi that oi 365
days and six hours 55 5 bird holding its tail in its mouth occur
equally in both texts¹. Δ

Speaking about the marginal remarks and insertione oi the
Add. MS, I must not omit to notice 5 very important feature in
their composition: it is evident that they were written at very
different periods. After the collection had been compiled the
person ior whom it was made seems to have gone through it two
or three times Two observatione lead me to thie conclusion.
Some of the entries, especially where additional matter has been
inserted on blank peges, are in distinctly later handwriting (ior
instance, 196 a). A note has been added sometimes where
originally there was only a “N⁸” to show that the passage
deserved special attention This peculiarity explains the presence
oi one or two write which do not occur in Bracton’s treatise
(195 5), aud seem to have been especially inserted 5555555 they
did not occur there ¹.

Another point requires careful consideration: among the
marginal notes oi the Add. MS. there 15 5 certain number oi
references to cases, mostly very incomplete, jotted down by the
annotator from general recollection, without any attempt 55 ”
definite quotation. One can lancy that in reading through the
mpodt 51 5 trial of 1227 Bracton was struck by its similarity
witha case which had come under his own persoual knowledge,
and wrote down in the'margin: “iere casus Oole'’ (40 b)⁸. A
very good instance is given on 185 5. The text recites interesting
pleadings 51 some pensants trying to vindicate their right oi
