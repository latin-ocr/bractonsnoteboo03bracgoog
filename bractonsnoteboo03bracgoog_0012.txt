faosimiles of the manuscripts3 he gets an index
where he should have had a digest, perhaps a
translation 3 the luxury of cancelling sheets instead
of confessing some stupid blunders, has been denied
me, and I arn sure that there must be moreto be
learned about Braoton’s life than I have been able to
discover: at this eleventh‚ nay thirteenth, hour I
find what I believe to be his marks on a roll of
King John's reign (Coram Rege Roll, No 18). But
as his treatise had lately been edited at the expense
'of the nation, and as there was no learned society .
ffiwhose business it was to encourage the study of
English legal history (for the Salden Society was
not yet born nor even thought ol), it seemed likely
that the Note Book would remain unprinted for
many years, unless some one would make such an
edition of it as could be made at his own cost and
without giving to it all his time Perhaps I was not
the man for the wor'k3 but I have liked it well.
