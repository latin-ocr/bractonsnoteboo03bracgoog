§a Of the Date os Bronton-’s Proetiae.

Now Ι have made no effert to settle Bracton's text;

lfhbtm. this could not be done as a byc work; some day it will, we

unflnsneu

may hope, be the serious task of a competent scholar. It
seemed to mc that I should best be furthering that task by
publishing this Note Book. So though Ι have occasionally
examined such MSS. of the treatise as lay readiest to hand,
Ihave not gone very far behind the printed text. Enough
hasbeen said however to show that the printed text is very
untrustworthy, that it contains many things which were
better in the margin or in an appendix3 and, this being so,
the problem of assigning a date to the treatise, is obviously
difficult. ln particular we may be induced to fix too late a
date by some few passages which will turn out to bc no part
of the original work Still if this danger be had in minda
few cautious conclusione may be attained which will be
valuable in the course of our argument. The first conclusion,⁴
as I think, is this that the book is unfinished, end therefore,

'The bonose

That it is an unfinished book seems most likely. The
last part of it consiste of an elaborate treatise on the writ of
right. We naturally expect that this will end with some
account of the trial, the duel and the grand assize. About
this much might have been written which would have been
of great use to practitioners ; it is the consummation of the
whole procedure; all that has gone before touching the forms
of writ and count, the summenses, defaults, esaeiae, warran-

⁴ ties, exceptione, should be preliminary. But we are dis·

appointed3 instead of that for which we look we get three
brief chapters about the mesae and final process in personal
actions3 and so ends the hook. This unsatisfactory ending
is enough to ronse suspicion and the suspicionis confirmed if

we remember that, when dealing with the trial by battle of
criminal cases, Bracton told us thatthe reason for a certain
rule would be given below when the wager of battle in a
