made clear by this book, but the exact extent ol the tenant's
power of alienation does not come out very plainly. It
should be remembered the whole learning and even the very
conception of ‘ estates’ belongs to a later time: Bracton had
not the word ‘estate’, nor any equivalent for it. Also
it should be remembered that but a short time back the
man who held land to him and his hcirs could by no means
,always disappoint his heir apparent¹. Just a traca or two
of this we may find, but on the whole it belongs to the
past3 the heir apparent may be disinherited. As against
the lord freedom of alienation, (in favour whereof Bracton
argues with unusual earnestness³,) seems very perfect, and
we look in vein for cases to show that the restrictiva clause

in the charter of 1217 had any considerable effect: we may
well doubt whether the king’s justices thought well of that
clause or of some other clauses in the charter⁴. Primo-
geniture is extending itself rapidly, but there does not seem
to be any very definite presumption against the partibility of
socage land, and much of it is still partible⁶. The so-ealled
‘Borough English' oustom is regarded as a mark, though not
a complete proof, of villein tenure⁶.

novel disseisin, a true possessorium, which worked speedily
and effectively. The notion of seisin is firmly grasped3 the
parties, the jurors, are pinned down to the question whether
there has been seisin and disseisin, and, if so, there must
be no talk of proprietary right. Taking up at this point the
