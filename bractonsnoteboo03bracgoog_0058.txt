was doing ill; many sentences in his book can have been no
pleasant reading for Henry. But between this hint that the
barunage and the incorporate reelm may perhaps restrain an
erring king and thc dogmatic statement that the king is
below his court, that the barons are his equals and his
masters, that il they do not restrain him they will be
damned, there is a vast gull.

»ι The discrepancios between these various passages were

*Μ brought to light in the great trials 81 the seventeenth
century. Every one cited, every one could legitimately cite
Bracton. But long before they had been apparent to at
least one reader. In the Cambridge library there is a sump-
tuous manuscript comprising Bracton's treatise and divers
other books 81 law. Bracton's text 1188 been elaborately
glossed by one whom there is some reason lor calling John
81 Longueville‚ a justice 81 the time 81 Edward II. Against
the passage in which his author expressly treats of the
kingship and says that the king has no peers (f. 5 b), he sets
down an argument drawn from the more questionable passage .
(1. 31), and proves with syllogistic parade that the king 1188
equale, superiore, masters¹. But indeed the contradiction
lies on the surface. conceivably the same man at different
times wrote 811 these sentences3 but he can not have
intended that all 81 them should appear as parts 81 one book;
one 81 them looks very much as if it had been written with
the very object ol explicitly contradicting the others. Nor
even were there no manuscripts extant, could there be much
doubt as to which passage should be regarded 88 the alter-
thought or interpolation. The statement that the king has
l'ellows and masters is contradicted hyat least five statements
found in all parts 81 the book.
