which deserves note. There is a case en it which has been
discidered by the intrusien cf a postseript; one ought to
read what comes below before what stands above. Against
this he who secred the roll has scribbled (the words are faint
bnt legible)-prhuo scribatur ibi postea suprc; this is a
direction to the copyist to transpose two sentences. We
may then conclude with some certainty that the Note Book
once had extracts from this roll. The second of the two
rolls now in question, was the record of the cyre cf ala 3
in Lincolnshire, an eyre in which Pateshull apparently took
part and from which Bracton cites a case¹.

What else, if anything, may have been lost from the
end of the book we cannot decide3 but the fact that no
secred roll has been sonnd sor any year from hu. 22 to An. 40
both inclusive, a period srom which very many rolls are still
preserved, tends towards proof that there cannot have been
many extracts in the Note Book of later date than the latest
of those which now appear there. Beyond Aa. 40 my search
has not been systematically prosecuted, and it must be
'consessed that the discovery of any rolls of considerably later
date, bearing marks of just thc kind that has here been
described, would bring some of my inferences to the ground;
'but having compared roll after roll, case by case, with my
transcript of the Note Book, it seems to me quite certain that
the marks on the rolls were put there by the compiler of . the
Note Book.
