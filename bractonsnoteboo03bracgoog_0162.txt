proprietary causes-this seems the main clue to the history
of the real actions. In this book we may pick up the thread
It is hopeless to attach the matter in the Year Books without
attaining in earlier law; the material has become much too
complex3 a beginning must be found when as yet the writs
of entry were novelties and the proprietary writ of right was
still sharply opposed to the possessory assizes¹. This sharp
contrast is emphasized hythe large mass of litigation about
advowsons and presentations whichis here published. It
may be repulsive to the modern maden but is he is in
carnest with legal history he may be asked not to shirk
it, for in studying it he may acquire a tight hold of the idea
of seisin. The intrusion of that all pervading idea even into
the region of marriage will not escape him².

ffi’tiian- In the eyes of a few connoisseurs the gems of this collec-

4* tion may be two cases which seem to show that feoffments to
uses are as oldas the days of Henry the Third³. Perhaps
the cases which will find most readers (if indeed any of them
be read at all) will be those about common rights and those
about villeinage. As to common rights, the typical struggle
of the timeisnotastruggle between lord and commoners, buta
struggle between the men or the lords of two different town-
ships. The social and economic position of the villein we are
beginning to understand from the monastic cartularieS, but¹
to fix his legal position we must have litigation in the king's
court, and this desirable end some of the many cases here
printed should certainly serve.

Lastly there are two tasks which should be undertaken
without much delay. In the first place Bracton's treatise
ought to be carefully and lovingly edited. If this be not
done by an Englishman, it will be done by a foreigner, as it
is written, Vocabo snper cos pentem robustam et longinquam
